# Digit Recognition using MNIST dataset

MNIST handwritten digit dataset is one of the most popular datasets utilised for machine learning and deep learning. It consists of 0-9 handwritten digits split in 60000 training and 10000 testing sets.

I evaluated various machine learning algorithms and a simple convolutional neural network to classify the images and got the following results:

 |Algorithm|Accuracy|
 |---------|--------|
 |LogisticRegression|91.97%|
 RandomForestClassifier       |94.79%
 KNeighborsClassifier         |96.16%
 SVM                          |92.66%
 LinearSVM                    |91.79%
 GaussianNB                   |58.16%
 DecisionTreeClassifier       |87.73%
 CNN                          |99.29%
